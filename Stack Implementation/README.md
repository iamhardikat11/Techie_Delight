# [Stack Implementation in C](https://www.techiedelight.com/stack-implementation/)
### A stack is a linear data structure that serves as a collection of elements, with three main operations.

Push operation, which adds an element to the stack.
Pop operation, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed, and
Peek operation, which returns the top element without modifying the stack.
 
The push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for Last–In, First–Out).

A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space for push operation, then the stack is considered in an overflow state.

#### Stack Implementation using an array:

A (bounded) stack can be easily implemented using an array. The first element of the stack (i.e., bottom-most element) is stored at the 0'th index in the array (assuming zero-based indexing). The second element will be stored at index 1 and so on… We also maintain a variable top to keep track of the stack’s size by recording the total number of items pushed so far. It points to a location in the array where the next element is to be inserted. Thus, the stack itself can be effectively implemented as a 3–element structure:
###### structure stack:
    maxsize : integer
    top : integer
    items : array of item
